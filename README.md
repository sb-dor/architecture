## Project Description

This project is based on the
official [Flutter Architecture Guidelines](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture)
to maintain a clean, modular, and scalable codebase.

In this implementation, the components typically referred to as *ViewModels* in the Flutter
documentation are named **Controllers**. Feel free to call them *ViewModels* if that aligns better
with your preferences - their functionality remains the same.
